# Designing headings with HTML-Tags 

### A sensible heading structure makes reading easier and is also important for search engine optimization:

# `<h1>` is the biggest header. It is used for main headlines. Each page should have only one main headline.
## `<h2>` this header is a bit smaller and will be used for subheadings.
### `<h3>` is well suited for second subheadings.
#### `<h4>` you only should use if you need more subheadings after a `<h3>` heading.
##### `<h5>` only should be used in footers.
###### Same applies to `<h6>`.
